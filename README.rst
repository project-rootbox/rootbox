Rootbox
=======

**NO LONGER MAINTAINED:** Rootbox has largely been replaced by another, much better project
I created: `IsolateKit <https://github.com/kirbyfan64/isolatekit>`_. Documentation is
definitely still lacking, but it's overall a large improvement over Rootbox.

Rootbox is a tool that lets you create and distribute “boxes”: isolated
environments designed for building code thanks to the power of chroots and mounts.

Unlike full-blown containerization tools like Docker and rkt, Rootbox is
intentionally **non-secure**. This allows it to be incredibly lightweight,
ideally suited for creating portable, reproducible development environments.
