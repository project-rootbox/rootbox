Rootbox
=======

Rootbox is a tool that lets you create and distribute “boxes”: isolated
environments designed for building code thanks to the power of chroots and mounts.

Unlike full-blown containerization tools like Docker and rkt, Rootbox is
intentionally **non-secure**. This allows it to be incredibly lightweight,
ideally suited for creating portable, reproducible development environments.
